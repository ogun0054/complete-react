      /**
       * What is React?
       * - React is an extremely popular declarative component-based,state-driven JS library
       * for building user interfaces, created by Facebook
       *
       * - Based on components : components are the building block for user interfaces in React.
       * - Declarative : We describe how components look like and how they work
       *   using a declarative syntax called JSX(html,css,javascript,other component),
       *   React is abstraction away from DOM: we never touch the DOM
       * - State-driven : React reacts to state changes by re-rendering the UI
       * - Javascript Library :
       * - Extremely popular : React is extremely popular
       * - Created by facebook : React was created in 2011 by Jordan Walke,
       *   an engineer working at Facebook at the time
